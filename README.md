Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

You should create one R script called run\_analysis.R that does the
following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. Extracts
only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each
measurement. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in
the data set Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity
names. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of
each variable for each activity and each subject. Steps to work on this
course project

Download the data source and put into a folder on your local drive.
You'll have a UCI HAR Dataset folder. Put run\_analysis.R in the parent
folder of UCI HAR Dataset, then set it as your working directory using
setwd() function in RStudio. Run source("run\_analysis.R"), then it will
generate a new file tiny\_data.txt in your working directory.
Dependencies

run\_analysis.R file will help you to install the dependencies
automatically. It depends on reshape2 and data.table.
